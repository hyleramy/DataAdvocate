As datasets become publically available, the importance of having correct data ensures the competance and performance of analysis. This provides an effective foundation to assessing human ecological, environmental, climatic, and archeological research. The Area of interest in located in Citrus County, FL known as the "Square Lake." The hydrology analysis utilized software to assess the ground points of the "Square Lake" to determine whether it was classified as ground or hydrology.


## Site Background - Citrus County, FL
### "The Gem of Florida's Nature Coast"

Citrus County, located on "Florida's Nature Coast", is located 70 miles north of Tampa and 60 miles northwest of Orlando, along Florida's west-central coast and the Gulf of Mexico.The surrounding counties include Levy to the north and northwest, Marion to the northeast, Sumter to the east and southeast, and Hernando to the south. 

There are two incorporated cities within the county: Inverness and Crystal River. The City of Crystal River located on the West Side of the County occupies approximately 3,636 acres. Inverness, the County Seat, located on the East Side of the County occupies approximately 4,578 acres.

Citrus County consists of three general physiographic regions: Coastal, Central Ridge, and the Lakes and River. The Coastal Area covers approximately 112,671 acres and parallels the Gulf of Mexico. It may be described as: 1000 feet west of Highway US 19, north from the Hernando County line to the Withlacoochee River. Located between Highways US 19 and US 41, the Central Ridge occupies approximately 217,797 acres and is considered the largest of the three regions. The Lakes and Rivers Area occupies approximately 82,370 acres in the north and eastern portions of the County.

There are no natural sand beaches along the coastline of the County. However, there is one man-made saltwater beach located on Fort Island Trail west of Crystal River. The communities of Hernando and Inverness host several freshwater beaches on the Tsala Apopka Chain of Lakes.The Tsala Apopka chain of lakes is 22 miles long covering 23,000 acres. The Withlacoochee River totals 45 miles of riverfront.


## Application Resources
Tools used in this analysis include:

<a href="https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/">LAStools Download</a> - A system of tools used to classify, tile, convert, filter, raster, triangulate, contour, clip, and polygonize (or shape) LiDAR data

<a href="http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html">SAGA-GIS</a> - SAGA stands for System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses which is a  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software designed to easily and effectively implement spatial algorithms

<a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer-desktop/download">ESRI ArcGIS/ArcMap</a> - ArcMap is the central application used in ArcGIS. ArcMap is where you display and explore GIS datasets for your study area, assign symbology/coloration, and create map layouts for printing or publication.
