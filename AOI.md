### Citrus County's Square Lake

Citrus County, FL is home of a recently discovered Square Lake located at the South Eastern portion of the county noticable in the Land Use Map depicted above. As this is an amazing ecological discovery, there is no way the data used in the production of this information could have been compromised. Unfortnately, that is a false statement. 

Data can be compromised over time. In this case, the hydrology data layer created using ESRI's ArcMap interface was modified in 2002 to reflect the hydrology within Section 6, Township 20, Range 21 incorrectly. Although the intent may have been formed by utilizing historical section files and large paper maps, discrepancies arise through different resources.

Here is an example of the data discrepancy compromising the outcome of this area. Within Section 6, Township 20, Range 21, you'll notice the SE quater section in red (left image; 2002) appears to be within Lake Tsala Apopka; the SE quarter section is zoomed in (right image; 2008) appearing to actually have land zoned Low Intensity Coastal & LAkes (CL). This is only one example of the research procedure required to assess the area to determine whether it is hydrology or land.

### Geospatial Discrepancy

This depiction is a screen shot of our current zoning designations. The void is countinuous throughout all effected layers. After noticing this error 3 years ago, Ive been on the hunt for an answer further requiring a ground assessment. Variabilities in elevation and classifying LiDAR point clouds can establish a better understanding on how this area is characterized.
