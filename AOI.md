## Area of Interest

### Citrus County's Square Lake

Citrus County, FL is home of a recently discovered Square Lake. As this is an amazing ecological discovery, there is no way the data used in the production of this information could have been compromised. Wrong. 

Data can be compromised over time. In this case, the hydrology data layer created using ESRI's ArcMap interface was modified in 2002 to reflect the hydrology within Section 6, Township 20, Range 21 incorrectly. Although the intent may have been formed by utilizing historical section files and large paper maps, discrepancies arise through different resources.

Here is an example of the data discrepancy compromising the outcome of this area. Within Section 6, Township 20, Range 21, you'll notice the SE quater section in red (left image) appears to be within Lake Tsala Apopka; the SE quarter section is zoomed in (right image) appearing to actually have land zoned Low Intensity Coastal & LAkes (CL). This is only one example of the research procedure required to assess the area to determine whether it is hydrology or land.
